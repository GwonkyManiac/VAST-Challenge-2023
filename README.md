## Background
Seafood sustains over a third of the global population, providing a crucial protein source, and supporting livelihoods for 520 million people engaged in fishing. However, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing threatens marine ecosystems, jeopardizes food security, and is linked to organized crime. To combat this, FishEye International is releasing datasets in mid-April, along with a series of questions, seeking assistance from the Visual Analytics community.


## Task 1
My task is to make sense of the information, understanding the relationships between people and businesses involved in fishing, and to provide valuable insights into the broader impacts of IUU fishing. Questions to answer from the competition:

1. Use visual analytics to dynamically display and explore context around the suspected entities listed above. What did you learn about each one? Can you connect them to illegal fishing? Provide evidence for or against the case that each entity is involved in illegal fishing and use visual analytics to express confidence in your conclusions. 

2. Use your visual analytics tool to compare and contrast what you learned about the suspect entities. Are there patterns that may indicate illegal activity? Use visual analytics to express confidence that a pattern exists and where uncertainty may be affecting this confidence.

3. What other companies should FishEye investigate for illegal fishing? Show how your visual analytics can be used to find entities that are worthy of further investigation.
